## v03.02.00 Boot Track

This is the boot track (track zero) z80 boot program for XENIX 3.2.0.  This was extracted from the IMD image of the first install disk from the Xenix 3.2 installation package.  The boot track is single density with 26 sectors of 128 bytes each.

This needs to be reverse engineered.

The install disks are found at https://github.com/pski/model2archive/tree/master/Software/Xenix/700-3039%20-%20XENIX%20Multi-User%20Operating%20System/v03.02.00
