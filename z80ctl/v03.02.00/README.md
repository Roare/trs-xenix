## v03.02.00

This is the z80ctl program for XENIX 3.2.0.  This was the last version of Tandy XENIX to be released.
This version should run on all machines with the 8Mhz MC68000 board set as found in the Tandy 6000.

This copy was taken from a fresh install of v03.02.00 on a Tandy 6000 HD.

This needs to be reverse engineered.
