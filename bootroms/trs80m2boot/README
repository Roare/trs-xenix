This archive contains reverse-engineered source code of versions 1
through 5 of the boot ROM used in the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II, 12,
and 16 microcomputers.  Note that the early versions may not be
suitable for the later models, and vice versa, due to changes in the
disk drives and controllers.

The source code uses long identifiers, so it won't assemble with some
common Z80 assemblers that only consider the first six characters
significant.  It will assemble with the "Macro Assembler AS" cross
assembler:
